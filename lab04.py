"""
 This program allows a user three tries to guess the correct answer to the question
 question = "What is the capital of California?". The Answer is "Sacramento".
 
 We first set max_tries = 3. then we create a loop to iterate three times. For each iteration,
 we ask the user for the answer (user input). Then based on the answer the user gives, we check
 to see if the user input matches the answer. If so, print "Correct!", then terminate the loop with
 a break statment.

 If the user could not guess correct within max_tries, then print 
 "You have used your allotment of guesses.", then print "The correct answer is "Sacremento!"
